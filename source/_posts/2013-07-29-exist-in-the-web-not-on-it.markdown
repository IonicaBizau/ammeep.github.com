I gave a talk at [WDCNZ 2013][1]Â - Exist in the web, not on it. It's a 30,000 ft view on how we can model our public Web APIs close to how HTTP was designed to be used, and an illustration of what kinds of problems hypermedia web apis can try and solve for your in your public Web APIs.

If you came to the conference, then thanks so much. I hope you had a fantastic day. Otherwise, enjoy the video.
