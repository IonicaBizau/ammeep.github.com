		<p> I work at GitHub building GitHub for Windows. I'm 'going native' these days, and loving it. But I still have a special place in my heart for the web. Oh, and let's not forget distributed systems. Actually bugger it - I just like building things. 
		<p/>

		<p>Fun facts about me: 
			<ul>
				<li>I found my calling as I was hacking in python while working in the Bioinformatics field.</li>
				<li>I once cloned the human Calcium Channel Receptor gene. Even inflicted my will on it using Site Directed Mutagenesis techniques. Pretty proud of that one. </li>
				<li>Skis 4 lyfe</li>
				<li>I have a bad habit of breaking bones on the slopes. Something somthing, ski within your ability</li>
			</ul>
