				Hi - I am a programmer from New Zealand and I live to make software.
			I work a GitHub, hacking on all things Windows. I have a soft spot for
			JavaScript, Distributed systems and learning how to build better software.

			In the winter my life becomes 50/50 split between the mountains and my laptop.
