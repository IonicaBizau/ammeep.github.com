	<p> I am a geek from Wellington, New Zealand. I love all things web, design, biology, and code.

Currently a software developer working at a small startup - GreenButton. We do a bunch of awesome stuff taking HPC to the cloud – and not just one either. Best fun ever.

I do a lot of my coding in .NET or Javascript, but am not exclusive. Code is code – and code is awesome.

OH and I freaking love to ski!
